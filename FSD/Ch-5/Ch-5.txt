Install: npm install multer

Multer:
-it is a nodejs middleware for handling multipart or form data which is primarily used for uploading the files.
-it adds a file or files obj. to request obj.
-the file obj. contain the data of files uploaded via the form.

->Disk Storage:
-it stores all the uploads in memory and on disk, by default we use local storage but you can also configure other options like s3 etc..
-it gives you full control on storing files to disk
-there are 2 options destination n file name, they both are function that determine where the file should stored

var storage=multer.diskStorage({
    destination:'single',
    filename:function(req,file,callback){
        callback(null,file.originalname)
    }
})

-Multer accepts an option obj. the most basic of which is the storage property which tells multer where to upload the files.
-Incase u emit the option obj. the files will be kept in the memory and never return to the disk.

->Storage: where to store the file
->fileFilter: function to control which file are accepted
->limits: limits of uploaded data
->preservePath: keep the full file path of the file instead of page name

fieldname=single:-
-this accepts a single file with the name fieldname.
