#X text 7 26 (not quite poly) is an abstraction that uses various voodoo
to fake the functionality of the [poly~] object in max.;

#X text 8 63 in short \, [nqpoly4] can take abstractions that obey
certain requirements and can link them together to make a polyphonic
instrument.;
#X text 9 111 since it automates the normally painful task of making
a patch polyphonic \, it is very easy to do things like 60-nite polyphonism
\, which really starts becoming granular synthesis.;

<up to 4 creation args>;
#X text 13 241 your abstraction is ultimately called with the parameters:

#X text 13 280 For [loadbang] \, you need to use the bang from the
right inlet on your objects that are written for [nqpoly4].;
