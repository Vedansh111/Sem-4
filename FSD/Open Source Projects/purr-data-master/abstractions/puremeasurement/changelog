changelog for the PureMeasurement collection of patches
-------------------------------------------------------

v28II06
-------
new applications:
- pm_decayrecorder: record decay curves in third octave bands, in order to
  estimate reverberation times.

modifications:
- pm_tfsiso.pd: dsp is now switched off when a new test signal file is loaded.
- pm_slm.pd, pm_tfsiso.pd, pm_scope.pd: changed names of global variables. 
  They now feature the $0- prefix such that concurrently open patches do not 
  interfere (thanks to Frank Barknecht for pointing me to this one).
- pm_filters.pd: now don't use global variables anymore.  

bugfixes:
- pm_filters_44100Hz.pd, pm_slm.pd: fixed missing connection in the 8000Hz 
  third octave band. 



v07IX05
-------
first WWW release
