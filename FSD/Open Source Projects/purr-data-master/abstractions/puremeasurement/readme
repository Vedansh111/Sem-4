1. Getting it to run
====================
1.1. Prerequisites
------------------
- PureData >= 0.38 (http://crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/software.html)
- iemlib >= 1.15 (http://pd.iem.at/iemlib/)

1.2. OS-specific issues
-----------------------
1.2.1. Win
----------
In order to look nicely, you may have to adjust the font sizes in the patches
(they are created on linux at a screen resolution of 1400x1050, so there will be
slight font incompatibilities whenever you use them with another OS and/or
another screen resolution). 
The default font (the small black one) is changed via the Edit->Font menu. 
The GUI fonts are changed by right-clicking on the respective GUI (or on the 
top left corner of canvases) and choosing "Properties". 


2. Using the patches
====================
The PureMeasurement Collection of pd patches allows you to perform acoustical
measurements with your computer (equipped with an audio interface).
They use the PureData software (supplemented by an additional library: iemlib,
see 1.1).
If you are new to PureData, please read the concise introduction by M. Puckette
(http://crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/Pd_documentation/) and check out the examples in the
help menu of PureData to get an idea of how it works.
When launching PureData, there should be messages stating that all parts of 
iemlib were successfully loaded (like "iemlib1 (R-1.15) library loaded!").

The patches are organized as "tools" (small useful things you could use to 
build your own patches) or "applications" (more sophisticated patches you can 
use out-of-the-box).

When using them, there are two main rules to follow:
- interactive elements usually have a WHITE background 
- look at the comments or into the "readme" subpatches


--HAVE FUN and get your measurement right,
Matthias
