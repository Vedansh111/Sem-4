  RRADical Pd - Conference Material
=====================================

This folder contains an introduction to Rapid And Reuseable Application
Development (RRADical) with Pure Data as will be presented at the Linux
Audio Conference 2 in ZKM Karlsruhe. The main text is in rradicalpd.rst and
is a simple textfile using reStructuredText markup. You can either read
this file or convert it to HTML, Tex, XML, PDF and many more using the
Python-Docutils tool collection.  HTML, Tex and PDF renderings are
included. The *.pd files are example patches for Pd. 

The text is full of spelling errors, needs some serious proof reading and
does not yet cover the last third of the talk which will be a practical
walkthrough to building a RRADical Pd patch. For that, just look ate the
"usecases" folder in the RRADical patch collection, which is included in
the archive rradical-wip-040325.tgz
