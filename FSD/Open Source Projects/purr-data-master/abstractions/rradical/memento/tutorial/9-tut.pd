#X text 45 62 THere even is a remote control built into Memento. It
is done using Open Sound Control OSC. OSC requires \, that send- and
receive-names start with a slash '/'. So now our state name (the argument
of OSCAbstration) has a slash \, and if you look inside \, you'll see
\, that all commun objects now also start with a slash.;

#X text 44 314 Also the abstraction now has gotten an inlet which accepts
OSC-messages. This needs to be connected to the originator's right
inlet \, its 'OSC-inlet'. Those messages are always send to a receive
called \$0-OSC. Just always use it that way. See the next part for
an example useage.;
