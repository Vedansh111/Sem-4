This is a test of network-transparent self-control in the new Memento.
It works. 

Start one Pd with: 

pd -realtime -nogui rrad-rec.pd noguiOSC.pd

and the other with

pd -noaudio rrad-rec.pd guiOSC.pd

Turn volume up in guiOSC.pd, and you proably need to select your own samples.

Then you get one Pd running with dsp on, but no GUI to disturb audio
computation, and the other Pd runs with GUI but without audio to disturb. 

You (almost) can now use the GUI-Pd as if it was a normal, audio-enabled Pd,
although that one is running (crash-protected) in another process.
