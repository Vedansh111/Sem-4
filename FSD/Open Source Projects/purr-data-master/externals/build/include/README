The complete headers need to be here.  "externals/build/include" is
mostly there for building the debian package.  All of the source code for
building the externals package needs to be included within the "externals"
directory in order for the Debian auto-builders to build properly.

The other option would be to make a debian source package for Pd, then we
could get rid of "externals/build/include".
