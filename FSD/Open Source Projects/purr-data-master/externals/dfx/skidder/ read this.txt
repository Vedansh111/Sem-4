These are the source code files files for the Destroy FX VST plugins pack.  
More information about them, as well as ready-to-use plugins, can be found 
at our web page:  
	http://www.smartelectronix.com/~destroyfx/
Also included in this package are CodeWarrior 6 project files & Visual 
Studio 6 project files which will hopefully make compiling the plugins a 
little easier for you.

All of the plugins use the VST standard, & should be (nearly) 
source-portable to any platform which supports VST.  Some advanced 
features may not work on all platforms or in all hosts.

These plugins are Copyright (c) Marc Poirier & Tom Murphy 7.  You can use 
them in your music however you like, without royalties.  You can also 
modify them to your liking.  However, if you distribute them (or 
derivative/modifed versions of them), then you must also distribute the 
source package in order to be in compliance with the license.  This 
software is distributed under the terms of the Gnu Public License; see the
