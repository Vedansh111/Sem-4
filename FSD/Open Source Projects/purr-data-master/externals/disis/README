You must have the appropriate bluetooth packages installed and working on your system in order to connect to the Wiimote.

To test this, type the following in a terminal:
> hcitool scan | grep Nintendo

you should get a response that looks something like:
  00:19:1D:70:CE:72    Nintendo RVL-CNT-01

you can also use 'lswm':

> lswm -l

you should get a response that looks something like:

  Put Wiimotes in discoverable mode now (press 1+2)...
  00:21:47:C6:4A:1A 0x002504 Nintendo RVL-CNT-01

currently there are no known issues with using this external.

NB: cwiid in its current state does not support all peripherals. Consequently, disis_wiimote comes with same limitations.
