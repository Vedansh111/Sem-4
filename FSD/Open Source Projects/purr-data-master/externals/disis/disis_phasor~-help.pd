#X text 41 218 DISIS version of phasor~ by Ivica Ico Bukvic <ico@vt.edu>
(c) 2009 http://disis.music.vt.edu. Code released under the same BSD
license as the rest of the Pd.;
#X text 40 262 The main difference between the disis_phasor~ and phasor~
is that DISIS version also outputs bangs every time the phasor completes
one period (this is however not exactly sample accurate due to the
internal Pd engine's minimum buffer size. Therefore \, we calculate
period completion between such buffers. This is typically good enough
for enveloping needs.;
#X text 20 15 click on "dsp 1" message to "hear" the sound (chances
are you won't hear it as a sound but rather as a click as it is running
at 2Hz but upping the frequency would obviously fix that part).;
