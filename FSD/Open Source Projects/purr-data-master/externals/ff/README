This is a small library that implements force feedback effects for pd.
It is BETA.
I might completely change this (see the TODO)
To compile:
make sure that m_pd.h is in your include path

patch your kernel with ff-patches from Johann Deneux: 
--( http://user.it.uu.se/~johannd/projects/ff/index.shtml)

He also has a standalone iforce driver available


type make.
Manually install everything :)

have fun
