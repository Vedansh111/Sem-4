make the objects behave correctly!
  currently [fftw~] and [ifftw~] seem to produce noise
  [rifftw~] just crashes
  [rfftw~] almost work...


LATER:
 use "raising" (see miXed/shared/unstable/fragile.c) to overwrite pd's standard fft~objects with these
 probably only use this, when the library is loaded on startup (and not via object-instantiation)
