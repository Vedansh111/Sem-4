 fluid~ - soundfont external for Pd
 orchestra in a box  by fbar@footils.org 

ported to Pd's C API by Jonathan Wilkes

fluid~ is an external build around the free fluidsynth soundfont synthesizer
available on www.fluidsynth.org Soundfonts collect digitally sampled
instruments. fluid~ converts Pd or (x)Max to a fullblown orchestra with just a
single external.
