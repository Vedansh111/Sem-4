threadlib binary:
  get them on http://grh.mur.at/software/threadlib.html
  and follow the instructions there


threadlib compilation:

1) open the right makefile for your platform/compiler

2) adapt the makefile for your needs:
     PDPATH should point to your pd installation (usually /usr/local/lib/pd or /usr/lib/pd)
     PDSCR should point to the PD source diretory

3) type "make" to compile

4) type "make install" to install help patches and binary
(you have to be root probably)
