TODO:
- PD could destroy present connections of objects connected to a sub-patcher when deleting inlet objects therein.
    -> how to deal with that?

- what happens if an error occurs during object creation (as it is only scheduled, not immediately executed).... callback with error message?

- define search path for objects/abstractions
