flashserver 0.2 - Pure Data server external for Flash clients
copyright (c) 2002 - 2003 by Olaf Matthes

flashserver is a server external for pd (by Miller Puckette). It allows 
multiple Flash clients to connect to it and to communicate with Pd in both 
directions. It can be used to control Pd using one or more  Flash frontends 
over the internet.

This object has been inspired by work done by 
Eric Skogen (http://www.audionerd.com/) and 
Oliver Thuns (http://www.radiostudio.org/streaps/).
It is based on my netserver object which is part of the maxlib library for
Pd (http://www.akustische-kunst.org/puredata/maxlib/).

flashserver supports the FUDI and the XML protocol. Have a look at the Flash
files to see how data transfer works. Flash version 5.0 or later is required.

KNOWN BUG:
In case the other end (i.e. the Flash client) drops the connection flashserver
only recognises this when it attempts to send data to that client. It then 
kicks the client. Otherwise the client would remain there forever. Thus it is
a good idea to sporadically send data back (even if not needed) just to see if
clients are still alive!
