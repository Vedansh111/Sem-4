shoutamp~ is a MPEG I Layer III (mp3) streaming client for pd (by Miller 
Puckette) that connects to a SHOUTcast or IceCast server.


To run shoutamp~ place the file shoutamp~.dll for win or shoutamp~.pd_linux 
in the directory of our patch or start pd with '-lib shoutamp~' flag. 

To compile shoutamp~ on Linux: compile it (for instructions see install) and copy
the binary to the directory where you saved your pd patch.

To compile shoutamp~ on win: get the LAME library from http://www.mp3dev.org and
compile it following the directions given there. To compile shoutamp~ type 
'nmake pd_nt' and copy the dll into the correct folder.
