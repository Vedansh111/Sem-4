New Pd-l2ork TODO
-----------------

[x] Remove all libs that _obviously_ are not included in LIB_TARGETS of externals/Makefile, which
    don't get built from tar_em_up.sh, and which aren't leveraging Flext
[ ] Figure out flatspace dependencies and whether we want to support any of them going forward (probably not)
[ ] Get rid of Flext-based libs that aren't being built
[ ] Get rid of Flext
[ ] Check duplicates like
    * externals/signal and pd/extra/etc.
    * externals/loaders and externals/import and pd/src/import.c
    * io and whatever else
    * grh and grill (and perhaps both can be removed)
    * pdp_opencv and pix_opencv and whatever is in Gem that might be another dup
    * check if footils is being used
    figure out which are currently getting build and get rid of the other ones
[ ] Check interesting remaining libs like
    * mmonoplayer
    * various stuff in tb
    * rhythm _estimator
    * supercollider
    * dfx
    * deprecated
    See if we want to keep/maintain any of it and whether it even compiles
