Download the package here : [[http://hangar.org/wikis/lab/pd/pdp_opencv-0.2.tar.gz|pdp_opencv-0.2.tar.gz]]

or get the latest version through svn :

svn co https://pure-data.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pure-data pure-data
cd pure-data/trunk/externals/pdp_opencv

===== GNU/Linux =====

(actually only tested in GNU/Linux Ubuntu Gutsy)

first install opencv development packages,
on ubuntu :

apt-get install libcv-dev
apt-get install libcvaux-dev
apt-get install libhighgui-dev

then get the _SOURCES_ of the pd you are using
and of the PDP that you are loading
( it might not work if the version 
is different )

then compile the externals :

  cd pdp_opencv

configure the package with the appropriate command for your system :

  ./configure --with-pd=<path to pd _sources_> --with-pdp=<path to pdp _sources_>

for example :

  ./configure --with-pd=/usr/local/pd --with-pdp=/usr/local/pd/pdp

then, compile it :

  make clean
  make

and copy the .pd_linux to your externals folder :

  cp *.pd_linux /usr/local/lib/pd/extra/

===== MAC OSX (intel and powerPC) =====

first install openCV MacOS framework
   download openCV private framework from http://www.ient.rwth-aachen.de/cms/software/opencv/
   copy the provided OpenCV.framework folder in your /Library/Frameworks/ directory ::
        cp -Rf /Volumes/OpenCV\ Private\ Framework/OpenCV.framework /Library/Frameworks/

then get the _SOURCES_ of the pd you are using
and of the PDP that you are loading
( it might not work if the version 
is different )

cd into the library folder ::

  cd pdp_opencv

configure the package with the appropriate command for your system :

  ./configure --with-pd=<path to pd _sources_> --with-pdp=<path to pdp _sources_>

for example :

  ./configure --with-pd=/usr/local/pd --with-pdp=/usr/local/pd/pdp

then, compile it ::

  make clean
  make

and copy the .pd_darwin to your externals folder ::

  cp *.pd_darwin /Applications/Pd-0.40.3-extended-20080315.app/Contents/Resources/extra/ for example
