X-Comment: On Debian systems, the complete text of the GNU General
 Public License can be found in `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2'. Also, some
 of the code included in this package was originally under a BSD-style
 license, but its thoroughly mixed up so not separable, therefore that code is
 not listed separately.
