TODO for rhythm_estimator 0.2:

* compute histogram array (table) size in rhythm_ioi_histogram based
  on the parameters ioi_resolution etc. instead of having it hardcoded
  in rhythm_estimator.pd

* have rhythm_slave_metro accept messages "start", "stop" and "auto"
  in order to turn the metronome output on/off.  The "auto" mode would
  turn off automatically after no input in eg. 10 seconds of time; the
  time could be chosen in the "auto" message itself

* debug rhythm_slave_metro and optimize its (default) parameter
  values; the debugging would be done with writing incoming onset
  times and outgoing bang times into two files and then looking at the
  sequences in MATLAB

* link all objects in one "rhythm_estimator.pd_linux" library instead
  of three

* make more examples
