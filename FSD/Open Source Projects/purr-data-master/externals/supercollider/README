Here are some programs and stuff to make using SuperCollider more
convenient to use within PD.

If you have never used SuperCollider together with PD before, here
is a quick start:

-Go to supercollider.sf.net and install supercollider. Make sure
 you get it to work.

-Replace the linux/extMain.sc file with the one in this directory.
 Usually found in /usr/share/supercollider/linux/ or something.
 The standard distribution of the supercollider language does this
 crazy thing about shutting down the server. Stop that madness.

-Go to the k_sc~ directory and compile up the k_sc~ external.
 This external automates the jack routing so that you get the
 jack output from the supercollider server into an object called
 "sc_in~". There is also an object called "sc_from~" that sends
 audio signals to the jack input on the supercollider server.

-Go to the python directory, and copy the files in there to
 your python site-packages directory. Usually placed here:
 /usr/lib/python2.x/site-packages/

-Change directory to the example directory and try to run the
 help-sc.pd patch. Make sure you have at least PD v0.37, and
 the latest version of the pyext external. (Earlier versions
 than cvs from 22.2.2004 should not be used.)


If you have a general questions (compiling it up, error messages),
don't ask me directly; ask on the pd-list or on the supercollider 
list.



Enjoy!
