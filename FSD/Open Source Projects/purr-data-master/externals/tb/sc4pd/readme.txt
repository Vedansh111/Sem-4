sc4pd: SuperCollider for PureData
(c) 2004 Tim Blechmann

sc4pd includes the SuperCollider header files and is derived from:
	SuperCollider real time audio synthesis system
    Copyright (c) 2002 James McCartney. All rights reserved.

Both SuperCollider and sc4pd are released under the GPL


sc4pd is a port of some SuperCollider UGens to PD objects. If you want to link
both applications, it's better to use jack.
sc4pd is using thomas grill's flext and should be portable to max/msp.
