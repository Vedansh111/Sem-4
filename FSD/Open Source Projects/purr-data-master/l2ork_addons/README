Place this folder in your pd-extended/ sources folder (where you have abstractions, externals, packages, Gem, pd, etc. folders).

default.pdl2ork goes to /usr/local/lib/pd-l2ork/ (necessary only if you've installed the core Pd package)

externals/ contents go to /usr/local/lib/pd/

see patches/ README for more info on the patches/ folder

register_mimes.sh is used to register Pd mimes with Gnome desktop. You need to run it with sudo privileges like so:

sudo ./register_mimes.sh

to remove mimes you can simply run:

sudo pd-l2ork.postrm remove

tar_em_up.sh and remove_svn.sh are dev scripts, so please ignore them.
