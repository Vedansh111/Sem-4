#X text 53 63 Let's start with another [struct]:;
#X scalar drawtut-rect 56 374 \;;
#X text 53 115 As stated in the previous tutorial \, all [draw] objects
have the same interface. The first word (called the selector) is always
"draw". The first argument is the name of the svg shape to draw. Finally
\, any arguments after that are coordinate and other data that define
how to draw the shape.;
#X text 53 480 You can select the scalar like any other Pd object \,
move it \, cut/paste it \, and undo/redo any actions you take.;
#X text 53 23 So what can we draw with [draw]? All shapes from the
svg specification. These are "rect" \, "polygon" \, "polyline" \, "ellipse"
\, "circle" \, "line" \, and "path".;
#X text 53 510 Also note that you can define a [struct] without any
"x" or "y" fields. This is because data structures may be used for
purposes other than visualizing data. But if you do draw objects with
x/y fields \, it will draw the scalar at 0/0 and you won't be able
to move it with the mouse in "edit mode".;
#X text 53 341 Below is a scalar defined by the [struct] above. As
you can tell it's just two rectangles. Pretty boring stuff so far...

#X obj 53 244 draw rect 100 40 0 0;
#X obj 193 244 draw rect 40 100 120 0;
#X text 53 270 You can use positive and negative numbers for the first
two arguments \, but only positive numbers for the width and height.
Coordinates and dimensions can be integers or floats. (One exception
are "flag" values in path arcs but these will just be converted automatically
to integers.);
#X text 53 184 In the case of "rect" \, there are only four coordinates.
The first two are the width and height of the rectangle. The third
and fourth arguments are the x/y coordinates of the top-left corner
of the rectangle. That's it!;
