#X text 18 18 Welcome to Pd-L2Ork!What is Pd-L2Ork?Pd-L2Ork is
a data flow programming language based on Pure-Data. Its primary focus
is on real-time audio and interactive controller data processing and
with the help of external libraries (e.g. Gem) \, it can also do a
lot of other cool things like interactive 3D graphics and more.Pd-L2Ork's
most immediate purpose is to serve as the backbone for the Linux Laptop
Orchestra (L2Ork) \, serving both its DSP and GUI needs \, as well
as an experimental platform for K-12 education through its unique K12
module.How to get started?The best way to get started is to check
out introductory tutorials that can be accessed through the Help Browser
found in the Help menu above.One of the unique features of Pure-Data
and Pd-L2Ork are its help files which are working snippets of code
that can be studied and easily inserted into your own creations.We
refer to such snippets of code as "patches." You can start your own
patch by selecting "New" option in the "File" menu above.Where can
I learn more about Pd-L2Ork and L2Ork?Check out Additional help
